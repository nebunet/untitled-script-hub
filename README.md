# untitled-script-hub

welcome to untitled script hub!

this is an up and coming script hub that will have a TON of scripts.

anyways, here's a simple tutorial to execute this...

# how do i execute it?

...copy and paste the loadstring below in your executor for the magic to happen:

```
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nebunet/untitled-script-hub/main/main.lua', true))()
```

its that simple!

anyways... have fun with the script!
