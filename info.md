# untitled-script-hub
a script hub i decided to put together for fun

hello! if you somehow managed to find this script (or i put this script out publicly), then i just wanna say a few things;

-all scripts used in this hub are not mine, credits go to their respective owners
-all guis were converted to lua using gui to lua (link: https://www.roblox.com/library/1343400903/Gui-to-Lua-Converter-Revamped)
-draggable gui module made by Spynaz (link: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/simple-module-for-creating-draggable-gui-elements/230678)

anyways, enough being said
have fun with the script!
